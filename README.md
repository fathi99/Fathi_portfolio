Data Mining final project as a junior data scientist.

# Final Project: Movie Recommender System (Project Overview)
* Created a tool that recommend a several movies based on 1 movie title with same characteristics. 
* Understanding the dataset.
* Cleaning data from the movie raw dataset using Phyton, Excel, and PowerBi.
* Optimized K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN) with a different metric (Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance and Cosine similarity) using RapidMiner and Phyton to reach the best model for  predictive data mining solution and used K-means for descriptive data mining solution. 
* Built the interface of Movie Recommender System using Spider.
